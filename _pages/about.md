 I am a 5th year Ph.D. student in the **Department of Civil, Environmental and Construction Engineering** at the University of Central Florida (UCF). My advisor is [Dr. Shaurya Agarwal](https://www.cece.ucf.edu/person/shauryaagarwal/). 

 My research interests include application of data driven dynamical systems approach in modeling various real-world systems, such as, traffic dynamics of arterials and freeways. 

## Education
* B.S. in Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology, 2017
* M.S. in Civil Engineering, University of Central Florida, 2021
* Ph.D in Computer Engineering, University of Central Florida, 2024 (expected)
