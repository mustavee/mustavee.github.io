 I am a postdoctoral scholar in the **Department of Civil, Environmental and Construction Engineering** at the University of Central Florida (UCF). I am currently working with [Dr. Shaurya Agarwal](https://www.cece.ucf.edu/person/shauryaagarwal/) and [Dr. Arvind Singh](https://sites.google.com/site/singhsedtrans/home?authuser=0) 

My research interests include data-driven traffic flow modeling, uncovering underlying physical principles from traffic data, and analyzing traffic dynamics through the lens of complex systems theory. 

## Education
* B.S. in Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology, October 2017
* M.S. in Civil Engineering, University of Central Florida, Fall 2021
* Ph.D. in Civil Engineering, University of Central Florida, Fall 2024
