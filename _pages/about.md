 I am a 5th year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Civil, Environmental and Construction Engineering](https://www.cece.ucf.edu/) at the University of Central Florida (UCF). I am advised by [Dr. Shaurya Agarwal](https://www.cece.ucf.edu/person/shauryaagarwal/). 

 My research interests include application of data driven dynamical systems approach in modeling various real-world systems, such as, traffic dynamics of arterials and freeways. 

## Education
